# MultiThreading - 1
# What is Multithreading?
# Threads can be thought of as separate programs running along side each other.
# However they run within one process, meaning they can share data between one another easier than actual separate programs.

# What is Multithreading?
# The challenge of Threads is that they can be hard to manage. Especially when a piece of data is being used by more than one thread.
# Threads can be used just for quick tasks like calculating a result from an algorithm or for running slow processes in the background while the program continues.
# What is Multithreading?
# We can also create many threads to try and find an answer faster. Perhaps we need to hash 100 passwords with md5. we could have 5-10 threads each hashing a password making the total time 5-10 times faster!


# How it works!
# We already use one thread in our programs. The Main thread.
# When we create a new thread it runs along side our main thread.
# On Windows itâ€™s easy to open your task manager and see how many threads programs are using.

# timer Program
# A basic timer program essentially hello world for threading.
# Each timer thread will output the current time
# Then wait a certain time before outputting again.
